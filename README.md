## Specifications
* Integration must be done in HTML5 & CSS3, without framework (bootstrap for example).

* The search field must be an input field, the text of which can be edited. However, the search functionality does not have to be implemented.

* Each accommodation or activity card must be clickable in its entirety. For now the links will be empty.

* Filters, although not functional, should change style on hover.

* In the menu, the links “Accommodation” and “Activities” are anchors that must lead to the sections of the page.

* The images must be of adequate size so that they are the prettiest possible while impacting as little as possible the loading time of the page.

* The site must be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox.

* HTML and CSS should be separated and the folder should be organized.

* The code must be versioned with git and must have a remote repo on Github or Gitlab

## Resources used
